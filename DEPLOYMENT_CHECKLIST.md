# ðŸš€ FinTrace Render Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your FinTrace application is ready for deployment on Render.

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. File Structure
- [ ] `app.py` - Main Flask application
- [ ] `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- [ ] `render.yaml` - Render service configuration
- [ ] `wsgi.py` - WSGI entry point
- [ ] `start_production.py` - Alternative startup script
- [ ] `instance/` - Directory for database and uploads

### 2. Code Changes Made
- [ ] Environment variables configured for production
- [ ] Database path uses environment variable
- [ ] Secret key uses environment variable
- [ ] Production/development mode switching
- [ ] Host and port configuration from environment

### 3. Dependencies
- [ ] All packages in `requirements.txt` are compatible
- [ ] Python version 3.9+ specified
- [ ] Gunicorn included for production WSGI server
- [ ] OpenPyXL included for Excel file support

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Run `python deploy_to_render.py` (all checks pass)

- [ ] Service starts without errors
- [ ] Health checks pass
- [ ] Application is accessible via Render URL
- [ ] All functionality works as expected

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Build Failures**: Check Python version compatibility
